# kafka-go-streaming
This is a simple project for showing working of kafka with golang
The idea came from the fact that, I sometimes surf through different blogs or articles related to different topics, and often I want to save them, but either I have to send them via mail to myself or save them in some excel file, and trust me on this excel files take up a lot of memory :worried:

So, I decided that I wanted to learn kafka anyway, so I just setup a kafka cluster in my local machine, and added a gui developed in golang itself, for storing the links with their topics and a short description in a local csv file (the consumer here). Below given is the image of the GUI that was created for this project

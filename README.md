# kafka-go-streaming
This is a simple project for showing working of kafka with golang
The idea came from the fact that, I sometimes surf through different blogs or articles related to different topics, and often I want to save them, but either I have to send them via mail to myself or save them in some excel file, and excel files take up a lot of memory :worried:

So, I decided that I wanted to learn kafka anyway, and therefore started by setting up a kafka cluster in my local machine, and added a gui developed in golang itself, for storing the links with their topics and a short description in a local csv file (the consumer here), the producer here is the data entered from the gui app built using fyne. Below given is the image of the GUI that was created for this project
